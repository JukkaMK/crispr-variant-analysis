# CRISPR Variant Analysis

This project explores how genetic variants affect gene regions in a
CRISPR-related context, with a focus on biological interpretation rather
than pipeline complexity.

## Background
Understanding the functional impact of variants is essential in
genome editing and gene therapy research.

## Data
Example variant data is used to demonstrate analysis workflows.
(No sensitive or patient data.)

## Methods
- Variant annotation
- Basic filtering and classification
- Exploratory analysis using Python/R

## Status
Project setup and initial exploration.
